# GShield
This script is meant for cyber victims, children, advanced home users or distro hoppers-testers. 
It features extreme security and as such isn't meant for daily use.
If you don't fall under these categories, do not run this script!
If you do, you do so at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused.
For security reasons, script should only be ran once and there is no uninstall.
